# Morse Library
 
This library parses regular English strings into the Morse code equivalent, and sends them to a port of your desire. 

The library supports light and sound output, so you can connect either a LED light or a buzzer. 

Send an entire English message with the `sendMessage` function. Send individual short or long 'beeps' using the `dit` and `dat` functions using your own, custom dictionary.
